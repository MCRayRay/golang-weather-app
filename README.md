# golang-weather-app
Command-line tool which displays to the user weather information

__Extremely WIP__

_TODO-s_
* Handle response from API (i.e., parse content, error handling, etc.)
* Can we mock a response for the e2e test? Maybe via a package which acts as an interface to net/http.
* Better parameter naming for ARGV
* Map of CountryCodes to country names should be a global constant
* MOAR tests!
